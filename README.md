# OurSolarSystemAR
Little game for kids using Vuforia. Using the images given the user needs to point to the asked planet in order to win points.
The objetive is to learn about our Solar System while having fun. Once the user finds the correct planet a curious fact about that planet will pop up.
I used Unity Engine and Vuforia for this project.

As it's a vuforia project i wasn't able to use github with it. Here you can find the apk. You need a mobile phone with android and AR Core to play.
